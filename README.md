Arduino Uno PCB Design on KiCad

After long hours of designing, troubleshooting, and refining, I successfully created a custom Arduino Uno PCB using KiCad. This project was a deep dive into schematic design, layout optimization, and overcoming countless DRC (Design Rule Check) errors, routing challenges, and component placement refinements.

I followed the "PCB Design with KiCad" course by Robert Feranec on Udemy, which provided invaluable guidance on best practices, PCB manufacturing constraints, and design optimization. Throughout the process, I learned about:

✅ Microcontroller Integration – Implementing the ATmega328P with proper power and signal routing.
✅ USB-to-Serial Communication – Designing the interface for seamless programming.
✅ Voltage Regulation – Ensuring stable operation with onboard regulators.
✅ Error Debugging – Identifying and fixing schematic and PCB errors through multiple iterations.

This project pushed me to refine my PCB design skills, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and gain a deeper understanding of hardware development.
